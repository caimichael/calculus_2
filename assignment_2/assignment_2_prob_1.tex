\noindent \textbf{1.} \textit{Let $f$ be twice differentiable with $f(0) = 6, f(1) = 5$, and $f'(1) = 2.$ Use integration by parts together with the given information to evaluate the integral} $\int_0^1 xf''(x) dx$\\

For the integral $\int_0^1 xf''(x)dx$ it is obvious that we must use integration by parts since the integrand is a product. Therefore, I am going to choose $u=x$ and thus $du = dx$ and $dv = f''(x)dx$ and thus $v = f'(x)$ because I want the $u$ term to become simpler upon using IBP. \\~\\
Therefore, $\int_0^1 xf''(x)dx = xf'(x) - \int_0^1 f'(x)dx$\\
$\left.  = xf'(x) \right|^0_1 - \int_0^1 f'(x)dx$\\
$\left.  =xf'(x) \right|^0_1 - \left. f(x) \right|^0_1$\\
$= 1f'(1) - 0f'(0) -(f(1)-f(0))$\\
$= 2 - 0 - 5 + 6$\\~\\
$\int_0^1 xf''(x)dx = 3$\\

The process to find the answer is a pretty straightforward integration by parts problem. After choosing the u's and the v's via Integration by Parts, I just evaluated the integral and then plugged in the values given by the problem to find the answer.
